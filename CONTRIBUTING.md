# Contributing Guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Set up your local development environment following the instructions in README.md

## Making Changes

### Code Style
- Follow the existing code style and formatting. This means no less than PEP8, PEP484 and Google Style docstrings
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment your code when necessary, especially for complex logic. Unless it comes to significant performance issues, I value clarity over conciseness although syntax like list comprehensions are preferred
- Keep methods focused and modular. Classes, and bases classes where appropriate are always preferred
